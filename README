PaintbrushJS is a lightweight, browser-based image processing library 
that can apply various visual filters to images within a web page.

You use it by applying a class to an element on the page and setting 
a few parameters with some extra HTML attributes. If the element is
an img or it has a background-image set in your CSS, PaintbrushJS 
will create a temporary canvas element and manipulate the image 
there, before finally saving it back out to the original element.

KNOWN ISSUES

Does not work in IE8 or lower (though IE9 should be fine), and 
Firefox / Chrome only work when files exist on a web server. For
